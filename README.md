The optional final task of this course consists of your own AI idea. We are not giving you a made-up problem to solve. Instead, we want to hear what kind of a problem you'd like to solve using AI – and how.

So far, you have worked within the safe harbor of this course. The goal was to let you focus on the content instead of learning to install and use new applications and systems. The content was structured as small nuggets that you could solve one at a time to eventually construct the bigger picture – not unlike a jigsaw puzzle.

But real-world problems aren't always served in single-serve portions. It's also necessary to practice the art of identifying a specific problem and sketching a solution without having a ready-made problem statement to begin with. Building AI solutions for real-world problems also requires that we venture out of our safe harbor and engage with the world. This can mean actively seeking more information about a problem, talking to those affected by it, teaming up with the rest of the AI community, and learning to use new tools.

You can browse example projects created by others to gain inspiration, but don't hesitate to be creative and to think outside the box. The best-case scenario is that, with time, your project will grow into something that creates real change in your own community.

Have a look at the AI Idea Gallery
It's time for your AI idea

To make it easier for you, we’re proposing you structure the project description around a list of topics. Once you have written down a few thoughts about each of these topics, you already have enough material to submit your project! If you’re up to it, you can also expand this into a working demo or prototype with code and data.

The topics we’ll ask you to elaborate are:

Your idea in a nutshell: Name your project and prepare to describe it briefly.
Background: What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
Data and AI techniques: What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!
How is it used: What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.
Challenges: What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.
What next: How could your project grow and become something even more?
Acknowledgments: If you’re using open source code or documents in your project, make sure you give credit to the creators. Mention your sources of inspiration, too.
To complete this final project and to earn final project honors on your certificate, you should submit your idea formulated according to these questions as a README-file on GitHub. If this sounds new to you, don’t worry, we’ll guide you through the steps.

You can use this template whenever you want to craft and communicate your AI idea to anyone. If you already know who to send the idea to in order to take it forward, we encourage you to do so – you don’t have to submit an idea to pass this course. But if you feel you want to share something fun and useful with the world and find people to collaborate with to make your AI idea a reality, read on.

How it works

Your AI idea project will not be graded by us (but if you submit an idea this will be mentioned on your certificate of completion for the course). You should think of it as something that you can do for yourself and your own community, not for us. It will also serve as a demonstration of your skills and your creativity. So even if the project is not required by us, we think it's an integral part of the Elements of AI journey: this is your gateway to the AI community.

Especially if you are doing your first AI project, you may feel intimidated and worried that it will turn out to be less than awesome. Don't worry, you can always continue to improve it and start new, perhaps even better projects. Doing great projects takes years of practice, but you have to start one day. Why not make today that day?

How is the final project made and shared?

We will be using GitHub as the platform to store and share your project.

We chose GitHub as a platform for the AI ideas because it has such a strong foothold in the AI community and in the coding profession in general. If you’re into coding, you most likely already know this and have an account, and if not, let us assure you that it will be useful for you to have one when continuing your journey. In this project, you'll be creating a GitHub repository. Don't worry, it's easy and it's something that everyone in the AI scene tends to do.

Note!

Git is for collaboration

GitHub is an online service for hosting git-based version control for software projects. Git is a technology originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, who is also known as the creator of the Linux operating system. With Git, developer teams can coordinate their work, avoid conflicts between different project versions and track file changes. Learning to use GitHub's basic functionality can be beneficial no matter what your profession is. It may even be newsworthy.

Your final project submission will be a README in your Git repository

The readme file (or README in all caps) is an established way to share the documentation of a software project for users and developers. In GitHub, it’s the first page that’s shown to anyone who visits a project. A good README contains a description of the project and a user guide.

For our purposes, it’s enough to create just the README page – a kind of a poster for a future project. If you make it nice and inviting, who knows if one day you’ll find just the right people to collaborate with to make it a reality!

For those who program: we’d love it if you include an experiment, a demo or a prototype with the actual code in your repository. It can be your original work, but don’t forget the lovely world of sharing and contributing with open source projects. No matter what kind of project you’re planning to get started with, checking out some interesting and fun experiments can be fuel for your imagination (some of these examples are even accompanied with open source code).

Note!

Remember the copyright

You can only use other people’s code, images, or other assets in your projects if the original creator has given the permission to do so. You can of course ask for permission personally, but sometimes you don’t have to: many creators license their work as Open Source or Creative Commons when they want to allow reuse under specific conditions. Even if a project is shared with the world under such a license, you still need to respect the creators’ rights to their work: for example, in most cases, you need to mention who the creator is. Sharing is the cornerstone of modern, digital culture – we encourage you to contribute to this culture by licensing your own work, too.

Create your project page

To get started, log in to GitHub. Create an account if you don't have one yet.

To create a new README, you need to create a GitHub repository first. The repository is the home to all your project files: text, code, images, sound – any assets needed. At minimum, you can create a text file and add a few images to beautify the project description.

Below is a GIF of how to create a repository:

repo creation
Instructions

Create a new repository from the ‘+’ menu and set up the project
Give your repository a short, unique name. The name can be changed afterwards from Settings if you don’t yet know what the topic of the project will be
The repository must be created as Public so you can share it as your Building AI final project
Check the box ‘Initialize this repository with a README’
If you want, you can learn about adding a license to your project (or change the setting later). With licenses you control how your project can be used by others

Create the README project plan

Now it’s time to draft your project plan into a README file. The README in GitHub is formatted using markdown, which is a common way to add styling to text. Markdown is used on many online platforms.

To make things simple, we’ve created a template you can use to draft your README:

<!-- This is the markdown template for the final project of the Building AI course, 
created by Reaktor Innovations and University of Helsinki. 
Copy the template, paste it to your GitHub README and edit! -->

# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
